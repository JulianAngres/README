# README

The program uses Python 3.9 64-bit. It can be run using Visual Studio Code, or Jupyter Notebook if the .py file is converted into a .ipynb file. It can also be run using any other compatible Python interpreter. Please make sure that you do not miss the Pygame window when the game is starting. Move the player with the left and right keys to bounce back the ball.
